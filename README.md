## **Election-Audit Summary**
This script can be modified to count any item by category not just candidates. 

        # If the item to be counted does not match any existing item in the item list:
        if item_name not in item_options:

            # Add the item name to the list.
            item_options.append(item_name)

            # Begin tracking that candidate's voter count.
            item_count[item_name] = 0
      
        # Add a count to that itemâ€™s count
        item_votes[item_name] += 1
